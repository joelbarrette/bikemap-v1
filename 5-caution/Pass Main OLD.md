Rode this with Matt in Summer 2025, absolutely skip this route if you can. Seems okay at first but when you begin the decent down to Hucuktlis Lake ther oad surface is in horrible shape.

Probably would be okay on a hardtail but you are way in the middle of nowhere and you drop about 350m at 20%+ grades on very loose gravel, its not fun. 

If you are headed south from Nahmint lake Rec, take Nahmint Main to Hucuktlis Main, its very new and in great shape but not on all maps.
