Classic TT bike training route, very flat with no stops. Kind of sucks since there is often large truck traffic but most drivers are aware of how popular a biking spot this is. If itâ€™s a sunny clear sky this route will likely have a strong westerly wind in the afternoon due the prevailing winds and onshore breeze effect. 

Toilets, fountain and picnic tables at the Iona end.
