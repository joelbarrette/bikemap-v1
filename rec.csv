Lots of room for setting up pens and hi-lining at all camps. Don't be surprised to see bovine visitors in any of the camps! They do come by to say hello from time to time.The Trapping Creek is only a 5-10 minute walk from each of these 3 camps. There is firewood available some on the ground and some dead standing.

BUTLER LAKE TRAIL,RTR - Recreation Trail,N,,,TATLA LAKE,The first 6.2 km of this trail follows a bulldozed road constructed for mineral exploration.  The road gradient is relatively steep at an average of 13 per cent. Depending on your vehicle type and experience level with navigating steep and narrow roads you can either choose to park at the first parking area close to Bluff Lake Road or if you have an ATV or small 4-wheel drive vehicle you can drive up the steep and narrow access road for 6.2 km and park here.  Because the road can be quite difficult to navigate we strongly recommend that most users park at the first parking area and walk or ATV to the second parking area and begin hiking from here.  The trail to Butler Lake from this parking area is another 5.4 km and takes about 3 hours to reach the lake.  There are no facilities at the lake but it has been used for a base camp for overnight hikers looking to explore the surrounding area.  From this parking area you can also choose to do a shorter hike up to Butler Peak which is only about 2.1 km or about 1.5 to 2 hours.  Due to the moderately difficult and remote terrain and the need for some route-finding once in the subalpine or where the trail becomes less obvious this trail is recommended only for those with backcountry hiking experience. The trail also provides an access route for multi-day traverses along the Niut Range with alpine routes possible to Valleau Creek basin Jamison Creek basin or Crazy Creek basin.,51.76529,-124.703242

The closure also supports the protection of important cultural values biological diversity wildlife habitat sensitive/rare/and at-risk species and Lil'wat citizens ability to carry out traditional use practices.In 2016 and 2017 irresponsible camping practises resulted in the food habituation of black bears and led to site closures. In 2018 the annual seasonal closure was enacted to prevent dangerous encounters with habituated bears and prevent further food habituation. The timing of the closure also supports the recovery of the local grizzly bear population.The Upper Lillooet provides important habitat for many wildlife species including the threatened South Chilcotin grizzly bear population and is a very important wildlife migration corridor for deer moose and mountain goats. Mineral licks at the hot springs provide wildlife with year-round nutrients. The hot springs are also home to the vivid dancer damselfly a species of special concern that is threatened by intensive recreational use. Ad hoc water diversion mechanisms and user created tubs disturb natural features and alter stream flow negatively impacting the ecosystem.

Cairns will mark the trail. Frequent bear diggings warn you to be alert as you are in bear habitat.

The first turquoise lake you see will be at your feet 396 meters (1300 feet) below you connected to the lakes above by a thread of falling water. Marten Mountain and Inverness Mountain loom ahead. The ""beep"" of pikas and the shrill whistle of marmots warn other wild life of your presence.Rounding a corner a raw and rugged landscape comes into view.

BUTLER PEAK TRAIL,RTR - Recreation Trail,N,,,TATLA LAKE,The first 6.2 km of this trail follows a bulldozed road constructed for mineral exploration.  The road gradient is relatively steep at an average of 13 per cent. Depending on your vehicle type and experience level with navigating steep and narrow roads you can either choose to park at the first parking area close to Bluff Lake Road or you can drive up the steep and narrow access road for 6.2 km and park here.  Because the road can be quite difficult to navigate we strongly recommend that most users park at the first parking area and walk or ATV to the second parking area and begin hiking from here.  Upslope from the second parking area hikers can follow a sporadically-cleared but fairly obvious route through subalpine forest that quickly opens up to views to the north exposing the Chilcotin Plateau. The route is marked with orange trail markers.  At the peak there is a wonderful panoramic view down Mosley Creek and Valleau Creek to the south.  To the north the Itcha / Ilgachuz Range is visible and much of the plateau to the north and east.  The hike to Butler Peak from the second parking area is about 2.1 km and takes about 1.5 to 2 hours depending on fitness level and experience.  Due to the moderately difficult and remote terrain and the need for some route-finding once in the subalpine or where the trail becomes less obvious this trail is recommended only for those with backcountry hiking experience. The trail also provides an access route for multi-day excursions along the Niut Range with alpine routes possible to Valleau Creek basin Jamison Creek basin or Crazy Creek basin.,51.76529,-124.703242
