I'd originally been to both ends of this road but wasn't sure if it connected.

After further riding around, we cound the connection on the right side of the road around (48.666028999076225, -124.50743050515412).

It seems at some point the road was pushed through but has since been thoroughly decomissioned. This is the view of the crossing from the Walbran end, it can be easy to miss coming from the Renfrew side.

Google maps shows another road called Walbran 1100, just a bit further down the road, there definitely is the remnants of an old road but it is fully overgrown.
