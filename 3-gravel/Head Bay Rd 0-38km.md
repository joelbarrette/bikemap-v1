Not 100% gravel, actually mixed surface, probably about 30% paved in parts. Paved sections are mainly on the westbound climbs for both humps.

The gravel is mostly quick but gets a little rough on the westbound descent after Bull lake. Heavy bikes may experience brake overheating as well since it's such a long descent. Also warning that there is a section of washboard in the middle of that gravel descent that can be sketchy if you don't slow down in time.

The paved westbound climb coming out of Gold River, pavement only lasts a few KM.

Some of the gravel after the pavement ends, nice and smooth.
