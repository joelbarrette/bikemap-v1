Mostly smooth but potholey, road that starts off Zebellos mainline and can be used to shortcut the Little Hudson caves section of T2S. 

Along Atluck lake the route is very picturesque as it follows along the north shoreline.

After Atluck lake the route is still very well maintained and wide, as it gradually climbs following the Tashish river. The route immediately deteriorates when you turn off on to NC1000 at the north end.
