Remote section of the KVR, no cell signal for most of it although there is lots of human activity as you pass through many ranches and recreational areas. Coming from Summerland it’s a consistent rail grade climb up until Osprey lake near Bankeir. I’ve noted a deviation onto the road since there is a nice rec area on the north shore of the lake. 

Water access can be tricky at times, while climbing in the westbound direction you follow Trout creek which early on is accessible but access becomes harder due to steep banks the further you go. This can be compounded with the fact that Thirsk lake is a reservoir and is completely gated off. Beyond that there is one culvert until Osprey lake that saved me on my ride but I still ended up riding for over an hour without water. I’d recommend bringing extra water if the weather is hot.

Another consideration is the path surface which is quite deteriorated due to motorized vehicles. There are extended 5-10KM sections of sand where hike a bike is necessary. There are numerous road crossing though so if the surface slows you down you can always hop on the road to gain back time.
