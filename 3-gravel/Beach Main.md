Smooth gravel coming from the north but as soon as the climb starts it's a monster. Sustained 10%+ grade with no breaks so low gears will be required if you want to ride the full thing.

Once you get to the "top" it actually descends and climbs even more. This is quite a hard part of the T2S loop. I ended up doing it in the dark which I wouldn't recommend, the descent on the south side was too steep in a few short sections without a dropper, YMMV though since it's probably easier to do with daylight.
