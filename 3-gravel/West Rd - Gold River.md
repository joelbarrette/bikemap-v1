No photos unfortunately since we were on struggle street while were coming through here, road is rough/chunkier gravel near the WR700/Twaddle lake end and improves as it approaches Gold River Rd.

The descent is somewhat sketchy depending on your tire size/setup, with 38mm I was on the brakes quite a bit. We had a few strapped down items rattle off during this.
