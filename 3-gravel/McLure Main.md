In the southbound direction the road conditions are great right up until you pass McClure lake. There is an active logging patch (June 2022) along the west shore of the Lake so I'd recommend avoiding this route during the work week or trying to go around the lake via the east shore.

Great pull out camp spot with water access, a dock and sitting/fire area about halfway down the lake.
