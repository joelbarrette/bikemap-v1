This route was recommended to me by a fellow bikepacker as an alternate way to access the Coquihalla from Tulameen for my trip in Sept 2021 since there was trail damage due to fires on the northward TCT section.

Path surface is chunky at times but very little sand so it's pretty easy to keep your average speed up.

This route is very remote but also very rewarding, wildlife encounters are quite likely. There's also lots of offshoot roads having a good idea of when key turns are will help.

There is a 4-way, x shaped intersection at 15.7KM that I spent 10 minutes going the wrong way at. The turn is key since it's where you branch off the Tulameen river.
