I've only had a chance to ride the part of this that continues south after connecting with McClure main. Right after that intersection the road conditions deteriortate quite a bit. It alternates between rideable and chunky. 

At about the 20KM marker (on this gpx so about 10 km from the McClure intersection) the road starts to get very remote as it winds it's way into Walbran valley. There is one slide that is somewhat unnerving to cross since since it's at least 100m down into the valley below but it's only about 10m long. I wouldn't want to do this with a vehicle.

It's worth the ride though since at the end you get to the Central Walbran Valley where there's a small shack setup for the caretakers right at the bridge across Walbran River. There's many activities and campsites here, such as the Emerald Loop and many longer day hikes into the park.

There are outhouses here as well, just follow the signs but bring your own TP!
