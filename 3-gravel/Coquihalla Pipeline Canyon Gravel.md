Going southwest-bound on this route was some of the most fun remote gravel biking I've ever done. The terrain starts at Hwy level then drops into a tight canyon which follows parallel to the Coquilhala. The route was created for the transmountain pipeline which is in active development so you will likely pass some constructions equipment/activity depending on the day. 

The November 2021 floods may have caused serious damage to this route as there are multiple bridges so use at your own risk. Any info or trip reports since then would be appreciated. 

On a side note, I wouldn't recommend this route uphill due to the combination of gradient and rough trail surface. It's dooable but you want big AF tires and serious granny gears.
