Great gravel trail surface except for a few chunk parts in the middle of the peninsula/island in Thetis. Keep in mind this is technically a non-bike area and there are lots of pedestrians and dogs off leash. I've never had issues but I always slow down and give right of way through here since it's not meant for bikes.
