Not that well maintained, my guess is the offroaders generally avoid this road since it's so close to the highway. It's somewhat chunky at time and lots of branches that have fallen onto the road, but not enough to require getting off the bike. 

There's also a nasty climb at 13km but once you are up on the slopes of Mount Mrkusien (around Woss lookout) it's actually really nice riding with great views.

At the 20km mark there's a decomissioned train bridge that has road barriers blocking it, we had to lift our bikes over which fully loaded was a pain. There's a bypass just before it that heads down to the highway.
