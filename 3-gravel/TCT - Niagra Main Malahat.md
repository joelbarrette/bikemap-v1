Quite remote feeling section of the TCT that rides far above the Malahat Hwy, there's a washout near the north end but can be pretty easily ridden through and the rest of the route is fast. 

Coming from the south there is a pretty serious climb right from the start that climbs a a pretty consistent +10% grade.
