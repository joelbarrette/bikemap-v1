Mostly fast gravel, a few bumpy sections but not enough to impact average speed. The roads get better the closer you are to Port Alice as well. 

If you are sore from the bumps I'd recommend taking the connector at about the 10 km mark to bridge up to the paved Port Alice Rd. since the paved descent to the Neroutsos inlet is very fun.
