This is the crux of the T2S section between Atluck lake and Port Alice. This is probably the roughest & most remote road of the entire T2S.

This is a spur road that connects J Main and Atluck Main, during our trip (June 2022) this is where we had 2 punctures that luckily sealed. There was also lots of recent bear poop so based on how seldom this is travelled I'd imagine a bear encounter here is likely. 

Even though the going is rough here, lots of loose climbs, there are no downed trees or sections that require dismounting unless you don't have the gears or confidence to make it.

Another rider who was riding this around the same time as us also received a pinch flat here so expect some difficulty here.
