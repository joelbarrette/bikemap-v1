Low lying multi-use trail that follows the east shore of Elk lake and passes by the Victoria City Rowing Club.

Many parts of the trail are so low to the lake that they flood very easily so can be quite wet at times. 

This can also be a busy pedestrian trail and it's quite narrow so its better to go at night or off hours if you want to rip. The trail surface is smooth, narrow and there are lots of tight corners so it's a lot of fun when you have it to yourself.
