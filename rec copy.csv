Please leave the gate as you found it. Shortly after the gate the trail narrows and enters a forest of small lodgepole pine. The trail winds across the gently rolling forested landscape and crosses several muddy areas before reaching a junction at 1.75 km just before Clark Lake. Stay left at this junction and follow the trail for a short distance to the forested campsite on the east side of the lake.Clark Lake is a medium-sized lake with a shallow weedy muddy shoreline. There is good fishing in the lake. Fishers should consider bringing an inflatable boat or hip waders to reach deeper water.The trail continues along the south shore of Clark Lake past the developed campsite and slowly swings eastward towards Maloney Lake another 2 km distance.Description - Cup Lake to Maloney LakeThe trail into Maloney Lake starts at the end of a small road in the middle of a cutblock. This trail is not signed and has not been maintained for some time. Look for orange markers on trees that mark the trail as it skirts the bottom of the cutblock and proceeds south. As the little-used trail nears the campsite on the south side of the lake it joins a road leading from a cutblock into the site. The campsite itself is located in a small grassy opening in the trees. Maloney Lake is small muddy and shallow. The shores are so marshy it is difficult to approach open water easily. However the lake offers good trout fishing if you persevere.","The trailheads into these two campsites can be reached from three directions: From the north via Trapping Creek Forest Service Road (FSR); from the east via the Main Kettle River - State FSR; and from the west via Beaverdell - State FSR. Directions are provided below for the most commonly used access route from the west. For information on other access routes consult local road maps.From the junction of highways 3 and 33 in Rock Creek turn north onto Highway 33.

Stay left at this junction and proceed for another 1.9 km to a junction with a small road on the left across from Cup Lake. This is the access road into Maloney Lake and it is narrow and has frequent waterbars. If you don't have a high-clearance vehicle you probably shouldn't attempt to drive this road. Turn left up this road and proceed for another 2.8 km to the trailhead.To find the Clark Lake trailhead proceed north on Lassie FSR another 3.3 km past the turnoff to Maloney Lake (a total of 5.2 km up Lassie FSR).

The closure also supports the protection of important cultural values biological diversity wildlife habitat sensitive/rare/and at-risk species and Lil'wat citizens ability to carry out traditional use practices.In 2016 and 2017 irresponsible camping practises resulted in the food habituation of black bears and led to site closures. In 2018 the annual seasonal closure was enacted to prevent dangerous encounters with habituated bears and prevent further food habituation.

For some the many crossings of Trapping Creek can be challenging during the height of spring runoff which is usually short but powerful and depends on the snowpack melt.There are 3 camp areas along the Trapping Creek FSR. Each will allow for 3 truck/trailer rigs to comfortably fit. Access to the campsites are on a first come-first serve basis.

3515,REC2372,SILVERCUP RIDGE TRAIL,RTR - Recreation Trail,N,,,TROUT LAKE,0,RDKB,Kootenay-Boundary,Selkirk Natural Resource District,,"There are three different access routes to the Silvercup ridge choose the one you are interested in.Via American Creek Road: From the boulder barricade to the ridge the trail follows the road through subalpine and alpine terrain. Panoramic views into the Lardeau Range and Goat Range and an abundance of wild flowers enhance the walk up to the ridge. Upon cresting the ridge there is an intriguing view into Healy Creek and across to Mt. Aldridge and Razors Edge. The Silvercup Trail offers a superb opportunity to enjoy an extended ridge walk through alpine and subalpine terrain. If the entire ridge is walked it is 25 km from the trail head on American Creek road to the trail head on Dirt Road. There is not a continuous trail along the ridge it is a combination of clearly defined trail and cairned route. Good footgear map reading and navigation skills are required. Travelling the ridge in poor weather is not recommended.Via Copper Queen Road: The Copper Queen Road offers road access onto one of the most beautiful ridges in the Arrow and Kootenay Lake Forest Districts. Upon reaching the ridge one has a choice of either following the trail northwest along the ridge to the Dirt Road trail head or heading southeast to the trail head on American Creek. If you are using the road it peters out near the timberline on the Dirt Road trail and is blocked by boulders on the American Creek Road. Via the Dirt Road: The first 0.5 km of the trail may be difficult to follow as it cuts up and back across a harvested area. Silvercup Ridge offers a superb opportunity to enjoy an extended ridge walk through alpine and subalpine terrain. Views into the Badshot Range and across to the Lardeau Range are spectacular. Visitors to this area will wish they had more time to go over the ""next ridge"" as there are many opportunities for side trips all along Silvercup Ridge. ",Access to American Creek Road: From the bridge over the Lardeau River at Gerrard proceed north on Hwy #31 for 0.4km to an unsigned road. Proceed for 4.1km on this unsigned road to a junction on a curve. Stay straight ahead at this junction following an older brushed in road. At km 6.9 take the switch back to the left and up. This section of the road has steep sections with windfalls and is eroding in places. From 8.7km to the trail head at 11.9km you will require a 4x4 vehicle or you can shoulder your pack and walk up the road. At 11.9km boulders block the road to all vehicular traffic. There is a parking area for about 3 vehicles with room to turn around. Access to Copper Queen Road: From the bridge over the Lardeau River at Gerrard proceed north on Hwy #31 for 17.9km to an unsigned road. Turn right and proceed up this road for 6.2km. Then take a small older road that turns back and up to the right. Follow this old road for 1.9km to a fork in the road. Take the left fork and continue 0.5km up to the timberline. From here you will need a 4x4 to go the last 0.7 km to the mining road that runs along the ridge. Although it is possible to drive almost the entire length of Silvercup Ridge on this mining road please refrain from leaving the road as the alpine and subalpine meadows are very fragile. The original old trail can be accessed by foot from many places along the mining road. One of the best places is just where the Copper Queen Road meets the road along the ridge. From here the trail is just above the mining road. Access to Dirt Road: From the gas station on Hwy #31 in Trout Lake proceed south on Hwy #31 for 8.3km to an unsigned road. Turn back and up onto this road. A high clearance vehicle will be required to negotiate the water bars. Follow this road (driveable for 1.8km) for 3.2km to the trail head. The trail head may be hidden by alders. Keep a sharp eye open for a 4x4 brown post with white letters on the uphill side of the road.,50.631487,-117.475413,,78927630,-117.4754127,50.63148707
