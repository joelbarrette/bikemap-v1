I've been to both ends of this road but never actually taken it. There's definitely a gate at the south end and it's quite overgrown but from the north end it looks like a regular side road.

I was originally planning on trying this out but after looking on Backroads Mapbook while I was out there it showed the road not connecting, while on Open Street Map it is connected.

This is probably a possible useful shortcut but road conditions are completely unknown. I'll have to check it out next time I'm in the area and not in a rush. I would not try this unless you are okay with having to turn around.
