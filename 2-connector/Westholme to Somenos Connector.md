Cheeky shortcut if you want to skip the climbing of Bell McKinnon rd or get to Somenos more directly. 

Coming down Westholme rd. it will look like a dead end but there is a narrow path that is pretty overgrown that bends to the right and down to and old hwy interchange. 

This does require waiting for a gap to cross the highway but once across Somenos rd. is a seldom used, fun to ride country road that leads straight into Duncan.
