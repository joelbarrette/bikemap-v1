A little sketchy since you have to ride on the oncoming shoulder for about 300m but it's quite large so it's not too bad. There's a little cut that crosses a ditch to Trapp Ave. Really handy if you want to get to the Fraser foreshore area coming northbound over the Queensborough bridge, mainly because the crossing of Marine Way to the west takes forever to give a walk signal.
