Along the trail, are some unusually large white pine and Ponderosa pine trees. As the trail descends gently into the creek draw, the temperature drops, making this a good trail for a hot day.\r\n\r\nThe Deer Creek Falls cascade in two tiers through the gorge. The upper fall is narrow and drops into a pool before cascading over the lower fall. The crystal clear pool at the foot of the lower fall invites dabbling. The entire scene is framed by a lush cedar forest. Bring a picnic lunch to enjoy at the table, while you cool off by the falls.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn, look for mushrooms on the lower portions of the trail. At other times of the year, shade loving plants such as Indian Pipe can be found.\r\n\r\nOn your way up the trail, rest on the bench and take in the peace and quiet of the forest. The only sounds you will hear will be the birds in the forest.\r\n\r\n",

The diversity and quantity of flowers is matched only by the diversity and quantity of visitors who come to admire the flowers and take in the 360 degree view from the lookout. This is not the place to come if you are seeking solitude. Despite the number of visitors, grouse and deer still roam the area, and an occasional bear is seen. Thus, if you bring your dog, please, keep it on a leash as a matter of courtesy to other trail users and the wild life. There are 2 trails to Idaho Lookout. Both meet on the ridge for the last leg of the hike up to the summit. They are the same length, but one is less travelled. If you would like to take the less travelled trail to the lookout, park at the Alamo parking area. The flowers along this section of the trail are every bit as showy as the ones near the ridge parking lot. A picnic table near the Alamo parking area is an added convenience, not available at the ridge parking area. Trail rehabilitation efforts are under way. Please, keep to the marked trails to avoid destroying the fragile alpine vegetation that you have come to admire.",

At the end of the street, stop and read the \"Idaho Peak Information Sign\". This sign has important road information. The first 2 km of the road is wide, not too steep and well maintained by the mining companies. After this, the road narrows considerably, as it switch backs up the mountain. As you enter Wild Goose Basin, you will find a pleasant picnic site on the edge of the meadow. From here, the rest of the road is clearly visible, as it switch backs up to the 2 parking areas. The most heavily used parking area is on the ridge between Idaho Peak and Selkirk Peak. The Alamo parking area is less crowded. Perfect! Park here to avoid the crowds around the ridge parking lot or protect your vehicle's paint job from the nicks and scratches acquired in crowded parking lots.",

				"SITE_DESCRIPTION" : "The first 6.2 km of this trail follows a bulldozed road constructed for mineral exploration.  The road gradient is relatively steep at an average of 13 per cent. Depending on your vehicle type and experience level with navigating steep and narrow roads, you can either choose to park at the first parking area close to Bluff Lake Road, or you can drive up the steep and narrow access road for 6.2 km and park here.  Because the road can be quite difficult to navigate, we strongly recommend that most users park at the first parking area and walk or ATV to the second parking area and begin hiking from here.  Upslope from the second parking area, hikers can follow a sporadically-cleared but fairly obvious route through subalpine forest that quickly opens up to views to the north, exposing the Chilcotin Plateau. The route is marked with orange trail markers.  At the peak, there is a wonderful panoramic view down Mosley Creek and Valleau Creek to the south.  To the north, the Itcha / Ilgachuz Range is visible and much of the plateau to the north and east.  The hike to Butler Peak from the second parking area is about 2.1 km and takes about 1.5 to 2 hours, depending on fitness level and experience.  Due to the moderately difficult and remote terrain, and the need for some route-finding once in the subalpine or where the trail becomes less obvious, this trail is recommended only for those with backcountry hiking experience. The trail also provides an access route for multi-day excursions along the Niut Range, with alpine routes possible to Valleau Creek basin, Jamison Creek basin, or Crazy Creek basin.",

The diversity and quantity of flowers is matched only by the diversity and quantity of visitors who come to admire the flowers and take in the 360 degree view from the lookout. This is not the place to come if you are seeking solitude. Despite the number of visitors, grouse and deer still roam the area, and an occasional bear is seen. Thus, if you bring your dog, please, keep it on a leash as a matter of courtesy to other trail users and the wild life. There are 2 trails to Idaho Lookout. Both meet on the ridge for the last leg of the hike up to the summit. They are the same length, but one is less travelled. If you would like to take the less travelled trail to the lookout, park at the Alamo parking area. The flowers along this section of the trail are every bit as showy as the ones near the ridge parking lot. A picnic table near the Alamo parking area is an added convenience, not available at the ridge parking area. Trail rehabilitation efforts are under way. Please, keep to the marked trails to avoid destroying the fragile alpine vegetation that you have come to admire.\r\n",

The first 2 km of the road is wide, not too steep and well maintained by the mining companies. After this, the road narrows considerably, as it switch backs up the mountain. As you enter Wild Goose Basin, you will find a pleasant picnic site on the edge of the meadow. From here, the rest of the road is clearly visible, as it switch backs up to the 2 parking areas. The most heavily used parking area is on the ridge between Idaho Peak and Selkirk Peak. The Alamo parking area is less crowded. Perfect!

Now, anglers keep the tread open as they climb the steep trail to Panther Lake, where they share the fishing with osprey. At the far end of Panther Lake, a terminal moraine creates a peninsula that is perfect to cast from. There is a good trail around the lake.\r\n\r\nHikers and history buffs can still find traces of the original trail that the old miners used as they led their pack animals over the pass at the end of Panther Lake. Listen for whistling marmots as you work your way up these passes. Ridge walkers will enjoy the Three Sisters Peaks.\r\n\r\nSet at the foot of the Three Sisters Peaks, Panther Lake, with rock slides to it's shores and sub-alpine forests surrounding it, is truly beautiful.

				"SITE_DESCRIPTION" : "The Chromium Creek Trail is located on the road to Perkins Peak, another popular destination with visitors and local residents. The Chromium Creek Trail provides hikers with access to a small secluded alpine lake with a mountain setting at the edge of the alpine. The route starts in open alpine and follows the creek down the mountain drainage to the level of the lake. The trail is 3.9 km long from the point where it leaves the road to the end at Emerald Lake. Travel time is 2 hours down and 2.5 to 3 hours back. The trail drops steadily from 2030 m to 1600 m at the lake. The trail crosses Chromium Creek at 1.5 km. The steep banks and lack of a bridge at this spot can make it difficult to cross the creek, particularly in conditions of high water. Due to the trail's remote location, the steep and uneven mountainous terrain, and the need for some route-finding where the trail becomes less obvious, this trail is recommended only for those with backcountry hiking experience.",
				"DRIVING_DIRECTIONS" : "From the community of Tatla Lake, travel west on Hwy 20 for approximately 23 km and then turn left/south onto the Miner Lake Forest Service Road.  Travel approximately 18 km and keep straight (the old route used to go to the right, but this road was closed due to stability issues). From here, follow the Jorgensen Creek road for about 200 meters and to a newer cut block and then turn right to follow the road south through the newer logging for about 1.5km and then turn left to rejoin the original route to Perkins Peak. Just past the 20 km board, stay straight. At about the 20.9 km mark keep left.  Go another 400 meters and turn right, passing through 2 large boulders on either side of the road. From this point the road is very rough, narrow and slow going, and a high clearance 4x4 or ATV is recommended. Travel 3.9 km and keep left.  Go another 200 meters and keep left.  Go another 100 meters and turn left at the deactivated road sign. Proceed 800 meters and turn left. (The main road to the right here continues to Perkins Peak). Travel another 2.5 km along this very rocky road to a small rock cairn and a rock fire pit on the left side of the road, where the trail begins. There are a number of mining roads once you are up the mountain so it can be easy to take a wrong turn if you are not careful. Travel on the last section is very slow due to the rocky nature of the road. From the trail head, the trail heads toward the head of Chromium Creek through open alpine and is not well marked, but if you head towards the creek the trail becomes more evident on the north slope of the creek.",

Those that do make the climb are rewarded with spectacular views of Woss Lake, the Nimpkish Valley and Bonanza range.\r\n\r\nHiking times vary but users should allow for 4 hours round trip.\r\n\r\nThe Woss Fire Lookout is a day use site and users are reminded to pack out what they pack in.  For more information, please view the Woss Fire Lookout brochure at the bottom of the page.",

The trail difficulty rating for this trail is considered black diamond, meaning it is a very difficult trail that should only be attempted by riders who are experienced and comfortable with riding trails of this difficulty level.  \r\n\r\n Lost Marbles is a scenic ridge-line trail on top with many optional rock drop features and steep, fall-line sections. This is a newly built, but Cariboo \"Old School\" style downhill trail. Some riders will prefer to ride this trail with a downhill bike, but it is also suitable for all mountain/enduro long travel bikes, especially for those riders looking to climb back up the mountain to the fire lookout tower using the new climbing trail that is currently under construction which parallels the lookout access road.  \r\n\r\n The trail is about 3.4 km in length, with an elevation loss of about 750 meters from top to bottom, and average grade of -21.3%.",

Follow the signs to the lookout from here (about 11 km). An alternate route is also signed from the north via Big Bar Road (access is via Hwy 97, north of Clinton), just a few kilometers past the Big Bar Provincial Park campsite.  \r\n\r\n The last few kilometers of the road heading up to the lookout are challenging to navigate, even in a four-wheel drive vehicle, as the road gets quite steep and narrow, with several deep deactivations, tight switchbacks and loose rock near the very top of the road.  Low-clearance vehicles and vehicles equipped with hitch-mounted bike carriers may experience difficulty navigating through the deep deactivations on the upper part of the access road to the lookout, so come prepared to ride your bike up on the access road or the new climbing trail that is under construction. If you do choose to drive up to the top, you are asked to park at a clearing about 500 meters before the tower, at treeline, and walk or ride the remainder of the way to the lookout.",

For now, visitors can expect the following: \r\n\r\n Recreation trails are available for local use at this time. Visitors are reminded of the directives from the PHO to avoid gathering in groups and to keep at least two metres apart from each other when using trails. Trail users are responsible for their own safety and should exercise additional caution as trails will not be groomed or maintained during this time. As well, visitors are asked to avoid activities with a high risk of injury to minimize potential impacts on the medical system. \r\n\r\n Recreation facilities where people gather and are in contact with frequently touched surfaces will be closed. Closures will apply to fee collection booths and kiosks, overnight shelters, backcountry cabins, day use shelters, and other related infrastructure.\r\n\r\n",

After a short steep pitch, the trail takes a more moderate grade as it climbs steadily through a tranquil cedar and hemlock forest with an understorey of mosses and shade loving plants.\r\n\r\nAbout 3 km from the parking lot, the trail crosses a logging road before entering the Kimbol Creek drainage. Look across the valley and see if you can pick out the old growth stand, known as the \"Cedar Grove\". As the trail ascends Kimbol Creek the pitch steepens, finally levelling out as it enters a stand of old growth hemlock and cedar just before the lake.\r\n\r\nKimbol Lake is a long narrow lake, squeezed between 2 steep sided mountains.

As you enter Wild Goose Basin, you will find a pleasant picnic site on the edge of the meadow. From here, the rest of the road is clearly visible, as it switch backs up to the 2 parking areas. The most heavily used parking area is on the ridge between Idaho Peak and Selkirk Peak. The Alamo parking area is less crowded. Perfect! Park here to avoid the crowds around the ridge parking lot or protect your vehicle's paint job from the nicks and scratches acquired in crowded parking lots.\r\n",

From 1972 to 1999, the lookout tower was staffed with an observer during the fire season, which was typically from early May to late September.  An average of 12 wildfires per year were detected over these years. The observer was generally posted at the lookout for 3 weeks at a time, living inside the lookout tower.  The Jesmond Fire Lookout tower is located on a very exposed ridge, at an elevation of about 1980 meters, and winds in excess of 120 km/h have been recorded.",

Follow the signs to the lookout from here (about 11 km). An alternate route is also signed from the north via Big Bar Road (access is via Hwy 97, north of Clinton), just a few kilometers past the Big Bar Provincial Park campsite.  The last few kilometers of the road heading up to the lookout are best travelled by ATV, as the road gets quite steep and narrow, with several tight switchbacks and loose rock near the very top of the road.  Visitors are encouraged to park at a clearing about 500 meters before the tower, at treeline, and walk or ATV the remainder of the way to the lookout.",

The trail provides access to many kilometres of open easy ridge hiking with great views.\r\nThe first section of this trail is a gentle grade that leads through a stand of large cedar and hemlock on the south side of Hanna Creek drainage and then enters an old cutblock. As the trail nears the end of the cutblock at 1.2 km the grade steepens and at times may be overgrown with alder. Hikers would be well advised to bring raingear for this section if it is wet.\r\nAt 3.2 km the trail reaches a low saddle on the ridge that is called \"Unnecessary Ridge\" by locals. From here there are several unmanaged trails that join the main trail. Old Glory trail lies to the right, and is marked with a small sign.\r\nTurning up the ridge, the grade becomes gentler and the sub-alpine forest opens up to allow glimpse views to both sides of the ridge. The trail continues at a moderate to gentle grade, winding its way up the ridge and starting into an old burn at 4.5 km. At 6.5 km the trail reaches a junction with Plewman Trail. From here Old Glory Peak is 2.0 km. From here the trail user has the option of following Plewman Trail down the other side of the Hanna Creek drainage to the trailhead (4.5 km), or continuing on to Old Glory.\r\nThe Forest Service fire lookout building perches at the very peak. From this lofty perch 360 degree views of the surrounding areas reveal Goat Mountain and Big Sheep Creek drainage to the west, Mt. Plewman and Highway 3 to the north and east, the view back down Unnecessary Ridge, Mt. Kirkup, Grey Mountain and Granite Mountain to the east, and Esling Creek drainage to the south.\r\n",

The right trail takes you a short distance to the campsite at Joan Lake. The quality of the left trail quickly deteriorates as it continues around the south side of Joan Lake and crosses a creek. There is no bridge at the stream, but hikers can cross the creek on a fallen tree. The trail skirts along the shore of the lake and crosses several large, wet, muddy sections before reaching the campsite on the east side of Cleo Lake. This section of the trail is suitable for foot traffic only.\r\n\r\nJoan Lake is a relatively large lake with an island, and reeds along much of its shoreline. The picturesque campsite is located on the east side of the lake in a small grassy meadow bordering a sandy section of shoreline. The lake has been stocked with trout in the past, and fishing is good. An inflatable boat or hip waders might be a consideration for those wishing to fish.\r\n\r\nCleo Lake is a small shallow lake with reeds lining its shore. The campsite is small and treed. Across the lake from the campsite there is a large cutblock that extends all along the western shore. This lake also contains a good trout fishery.\r\n",

				"SITE_DESCRIPTION" : "There are three different access routes to the Silvercup ridge, choose the one you are interested in.\r\nVia American Creek Road: From the boulder barricade to the ridge, the trail follows the road through subalpine and alpine terrain. Panoramic views into the Lardeau Range and Goat Range and an abundance of wild flowers enhance the walk up to the ridge. Upon cresting the ridge, there is an intriguing view into Healy Creek and across to Mt. Aldridge and Razors Edge. The Silvercup Trail offers a superb opportunity to enjoy an extended ridge walk through alpine and subalpine terrain. If the entire ridge is walked, it is 25 km from the trail head on American Creek road to the trail head on Dirt Road. There is not a continuous trail along the ridge, it is a combination of clearly defined trail and cairned route. Good footgear, map reading and navigation skills are required. Travelling the ridge in poor weather is not recommended.\r\n\r\nVia Copper Queen Road: The Copper Queen Road offers road access onto one of the most beautiful ridges in the Arrow and Kootenay Lake Forest Districts. Upon reaching the ridge one has a choice of either following the trail northwest along the ridge to the Dirt Road trail head, or heading southeast to the trail head on American Creek. If you are using the road, it peters out near the timberline on the Dirt Road trail and is blocked by boulders on the American Creek Road. \r\nVia the Dirt Road: The first 0.5 km of the trail may be difficult to follow, as it cuts up and back across a harvested area. Silvercup Ridge offers a superb opportunity to enjoy an extended ridge walk through alpine and subalpine terrain. Views into the Badshot Range and across to the Lardeau Range are spectacular. Visitors to this area will wish they had more time to go over the \"next ridge\" as there are many opportunities for side trips all along Silvercup Ridge. \r\n",
				"DRIVING_DIRECTIONS" : "Access to American Creek Road: From the bridge over the Lardeau River at Gerrard, proceed north on Hwy #31 for 0.4km to an unsigned road. Proceed for 4.1km on this unsigned road to a junction on a curve. Stay straight ahead at this junction, following an older, brushed in road. At km 6.9 take the switch back to the left and up. This section of the road has steep sections with windfalls and is eroding in places. From 8.7km, to the trail head at 11.9km, you will require a 4x4 vehicle, or you can shoulder your pack and walk up the road. At 11.9km, boulders block the road to all vehicular traffic. There is a parking area for about 3 vehicles, with room to turn around. Access to Copper Queen Road: From the bridge over the Lardeau River at Gerrard, proceed north on Hwy #31 for 17.9km to an unsigned road. Turn right and proceed up this road for 6.2km. Then take a small, older road that turns back and up to the right. Follow this old road for 1.9km to a fork in the road. Take the left fork and continue 0.5km up to the timberline. From here you will need a 4x4 to go the last 0.7 km to the mining road that runs along the ridge. Although it is possible to drive almost the entire length of Silvercup Ridge on this mining road, please, refrain from leaving the road as the alpine and subalpine meadows are very fragile. The original old trail can be accessed by foot from many places along the mining road. One of the best places is just where the Copper Queen Road meets the road along the ridge. From here the trail is just above the mining road. Access to Dirt Road: From the gas station on Hwy #31 in Trout Lake, proceed south on Hwy #31 for 8.3km to an unsigned road. Turn back and up onto this road. A high clearance vehicle will be required to negotiate the water bars. Follow this road (driveable for 1.8km) for 3.2km to the trail head. The trail head may be hidden by alders. Keep a sharp eye open for a 4x4 brown post with white letters on the uphill side of the road.",

				"SITE_DESCRIPTION" : "The Trapping Creek Horse Trails are mainly old grassy two-track logging trails connected by enhanced cow paths and game trails, so the terrain varies. The horse trail network boasts several loops connecting the camps, with varying distances between 3-12 miles and several good creek crossings. Altitude changes on the trails on the North/West side of the creek are gradual. The greatest elevation change is approximately 1500' over about 2.5 miles. The trails on the South/East side of the creek are pretty flat. For some, the many crossings of Trapping Creek can be challenging during the height of spring runoff, which is usually short but powerful and depends on the snowpack melt.\r\nThere are 3 camp areas along the Trapping Creek FSR. Each will allow for 3 truck/trailer rigs to comfortably fit. Access to the campsites are on a first come-first serve basis. Other recreational campers also utilize these sites and in the late fall the area is very popular with hunters. \r\n\r\nThe camping areas are primitive, but all have rock fire-pits. You will need to bring your own water as the creeks, while close by, aren't close enough for packing water. The 3 camps along the FSR also all have lovely shady areas for your horses. Lots of room for setting up pens and hi-lining at all camps. Don't be surprised to see bovine visitors in any of the camps! They do come by to say hello from time to time.\r\n\r\nThe Trapping Creek is only a 5-10 minute walk from each of these 3 camps. There is firewood available, some on the ground and some dead standing. No shortage, but you will have to work for it. Bring your chainsaw. These camps can be a bit dusty during dry weather since they are right beside the Trapping Creek FSR, which is well-used by other Back Country enthusiasts and is active logging going on in the area on weekdays.\r\n",

The trail passes across the scree slopes underneath this cliff, on the same side of the mountain you have been hiking up. Do not go around the back. If snow is across the trail, look for cairns marking the route. On the ridge, follow a well defined path up through the rocks and along a ledge. This last bit of the trail is precipitous, but short. The view makes it all worth while. From the lookout, Upper Arrow Lake, Nakusp, Lower Arrow Lake, Mosquito Lake and Whatshan Lake lie at the bottom of a sea of mountains that seem to go on forever.

				"SITE_DESCRIPTION" : "The Lilwatitkwa7 Trail and Mum&#787;leqs (Keyhole) Hot Springs are within Lil'wat Nation territory and have cultural and spiritual significance for Lil'wat Nation. The Lilwatitkwa7 Trail and hot springs are closed from Apr 1 to Nov 15 each year (spring to fall), due to increased wildlife conflicts caused by recreational users. The closure also supports the protection of important cultural values, biological diversity, wildlife habitat, sensitive/rare/and at-risk species, and Lil'wat citizens ability to carry out traditional use practices.\r\nIn 2016 and 2017 irresponsible camping practises resulted in the food habituation of black bears and led to site closures. In 2018, the annual seasonal closure was enacted to prevent dangerous encounters with habituated bears and prevent further food habituation. The timing of the closure also supports the recovery of the local grizzly bear population.\r\nThe Upper Lillooet provides important habitat for many wildlife species, including the threatened South Chilcotin grizzly bear population, and is a very important wildlife migration corridor for deer, moose, and mountain goats. Mineral licks at the hot springs provide wildlife with year-round nutrients. The hot springs are also home to the vivid dancer damselfly, a species of special concern that is threatened by intensive recreational use. Ad hoc water diversion mechanisms and user created tubs disturb natural features and alter stream flow, negatively impacting the ecosystem. Human activity at the hot springs can displace wildlife from these valuable habitat features.\r\nThe Mount Meager Volcanic Complex is one of the most geologically active areas in North America. In August 2010, warm weather triggered the collapse of approximately 53 million cubic meters of rock and debris from the south flank of Qwelqwelusten (Mount Meager), generating the largest historic landslide in Canada.\r\n",
				"DRIVING_DIRECTIONS" : "The Lillooet River FSR is NOT regularly plowed or maintained in winter. Travel can be treacherous. The road passes through several avalanche chutes. Public access is restricted by a gate at 9km during times of avalanche danger and times of elevated landslide risk. Use caution and check the forecast; there is no cell service in the area. Many vehicles have gotten stuck trying to reach the hot springs when the road is snow covered, or have been blocked in by avalanche debris.\r\nThe trailhead is located at 42 km on the Upper Lillooet FSR. From Pemberton BC drive up Pemberton meadows road until the junction with the Hurley Pass Road, turn right onto the Hurley Pass Road. Cross the Lillooet river, drive to approx. 6 km., stay left down the Upper Lillooet FSR and continue upstream until 42 km.

Alpine flowers, mountain goats, wild rocky vistas, glacial lakes, water falls... it all awaits the hiker with perseverance.\r\n\r\nClimbing from the trail head through an old cut block, the trail soon picks up an old mining access road. Near the end of the road, the trail takes off to the left, climbing up through the sub-alpine forest to meadows. As you skirt along the cliffs below Mount Dolly Varden, look for old mine dumps. Cairns will mark the trail. Frequent bear diggings warn you to be alert, as you are in bear habitat. Between 2.5 km and 3 km on the trail, a short side trip to your right, between rocky knobs, will take you to the old fallen down mine cabin of the Alps Alturas Mine. From here there is a beautiful view of the ridges of Dennis Basin.\r\n\r\nNow, the slope becomes steeper as the trail angles upward across talus slopes. Watch your step. The first turquoise lake you see will be at your feet, 396 meters (1300 feet) below you, connected to the lakes above by a thread of falling water. Marten Mountain and Inverness Mountain loom ahead. The \"beep\" of pikas and the shrill whistle of marmots warn other wild life of your presence.\r\n\r\nRounding a corner, a raw and rugged landscape comes into view. As you pick your way across the talus, mountain goats scramble along the rock ledges below a remnant glacier. Four glacial lakes rest between Mt. Dolly Varden and Marten Mountain in a landscape of rock and ice.\r\n\r\n",

				"SITE_DESCRIPTION" : "Mount Bowman elevation: 2243 m / 7358 ft. This trail provides good access for hikers looking to explore the limestone mountains of the Marble Range Provincial Park.  The trail is the access point for two popular hiking destinations within the northern half of the Marble Range: Mt. Bowman and Wild Horse Ridge / Mt. Kerr.  These destinations provide excellent views of the rugged limestone mountains and the surrounding landscape and valleys.  Views of the Shulaps and Camelsfoot Ranges are also possible on clear days. Further exploration of the alpine limestone ridges and peaks within the Marble Range is possible for those who want to do extended hiking and backpacking.\r\n\r\n After leaving the trailhead, follow the trail east for about 3.4 km to a junction at a small informal campsite.  The Mt. Bowman trail goes left (north) from here, up another drainage valley, while the longer trail to Wild Horse Ridge and Mount Kerr further beyond turns right (east). The trail to Mount Bowman continues to climb steadily through the forest and then into some wet meadows before finally emerging in a dry subalpine meadow on a ridge that can be followed in a westerly direction toward the summit of Mount Bowman. The trail is not well marked but the route is fairly obvious. When you reach the limestone cliffs, the final 700-meter ascent up to the summit will require some moderately difficult scrambling over steep limestone slopes and ledges with loose rocks. Watch for a number of caves high on the mountain.",
				"DRIVING_DIRECTIONS" : "Trail Head Location  51.164873 N, 121.921887 W (Decimal Degrees)\r\n\r\nFrom Clinton, turn west onto Kelly Lake Road.  Travel 16 km along Kelly Lake Road to just past the substation and before Kelly Lake, and then turn right (north) onto Jesmond Road. Follow the Jesmond Road for about 23.8 km and about 1 km past the Circle H Mountain Lodge, turn right onto a rough dirt road that heads east toward the transmission lines. The road is pretty rough and rutted, and only suitable for high-clearance vehicles. After leaving Jesmond Road, travel about 0.7 km to the transmission lines and turn right.  Continue following the road under the transmission lines in a southeast direction for another 0.8 km to a large clearing on the north side of a small creek. Stay left at the clearing and proceed an another 0.3 km to another large clearing and the end of the road.  This is the trailhead for the Mount Bowman and Wild Horse Ridge Trails. Park at the trailhead and follow a double-track trail that soon becomes singletrack and heads east following a creek up the valley.\r\n",

The rest of the trail is a very exposed. Hikers should be prepared for sudden weather changes, as shelter is very limited.\r\nFrom the meadow, the trail begins to climb steeply.

Until the Sulphur Creek basin is reached, the trail continues to be challenging and care must be taken, as falling rock, steep cliffs below the trail and a rocky face must be crossed. After this rugged section, the trail enters the meadow at the top of Sulphur Creek, where another primitive campsite can be found. In this area, the trail passes near an area of Karst topography with sink-holes, caves and huge limestone boulders that tumbled off the shoulder of the Three\r\nSisters. From Sulphur Creek, it is an easy hike up a good trail to the ridge. Once on the ridge, there are fine views down into Fairy Creek and Fernie; across to Mt.

				"SITE_DESCRIPTION" : "The Seven Summits Trail is a combination of what was originally three different trails. The three trails where the Record Ridge Trail, the Plewman Trail, and the Old Glory Trail. The Record Ridge portion is one of the easiest, most accessible high elevation hikes in the area. Along the ridge one finds huge granitic erratics from Granite Mountain. From the summit the city of Rossland and Northport, Washington are visible far below in the valleys. The Plewman Trail section is a moderately steep trail that is used as an alternative (and shorter) route to reach Old Glory Mountain. Just before 1 km the trail drops into the Hanna Creek drainage and crosses two branches of Hanna Creek. Here the vegetation grows lushly and it stays cool year round.\r\nAt 3 km the trail levels off slightly as it enters Plewman Basin and the vegetation changes to sub-alpine species. At 4.5 km the trail at last reaches the ridge top. A few scattered trees and gnarled snags grace the ridge top. Here the trail user is treated to views of Esling and Big Sheep drainages, as well as Old Glory Mountain. The junction with the Old Glory Trail lies just 50 m down the other side of the ridge. From this junction the peak of Old Glory Mountain lies 2.0 km further, and another 290 m (945 feet) elevation gain. From this junction the trailhead via the Old Glory Trail is 6.5 km. \r\nThe Old Glory Trail route is a ridge-hikers delight. The trail provides access to many kilometres of open easy ridge hiking with great views. At 3.2 km the trail reaches a low saddle on the ridge that is called \"Unnecessary Ridge\" by locals. From here there are several unmanaged trails that join the main trail. Old Glory trail lies to the right, and is marked with a small sign. At 6.5 km the trail reaches a junction with Plewman Trail. From here Old Glory Peak is 2.0 km, and the trail user has the option of following Plewman Trail down the other side of the Hanna Creek drainage to the trailhead (4.5 km), or continuing on to Old Glory.",
				"DRIVING_DIRECTIONS" : "TO ACCESS THE PLEWMAN AND OLD GLORY SECTION TRAIL HEAD: From the Museum in Rossland follow the highway north for 10 km to the trailhead on the west (left) side of the highway. The trailhead can be hard to find. Look for a 4 x 4 sign post and a small grassy parking area. There is room for 2-3 vehicles at the trailhead itself, and more parking space across the highway.\r\nTO ACCESS THE HEAD OF THE RECORD RIDGE TRAIL SECTION: From the junction of Highway 3B and 22, at the Le Roi Mine Museum in Rossland, travel 0.4 km south on Highway 22. Turn right onto the \"Old Cascade Highway\", across from the Rossland Motel. Follow this good 2 wheel drive gravel road for 11.9 km to the summit of Record Ridge.

Shortly after the start of your hike, look for a fork to the right which leads to a view of your destination, high up on an open ridge.  Back on the trail, get ready for a bit of a slog.  The next 1.5 km switchbacks up a steep slope through thick forest cover.  As you leave the forest the slope becomes more gradual. The trail traverses a steep hillside below a towering cliff.  About 2.5 km into the hike you arrive at a small col.  From the col, the trail continues to traverse the open slope below the fire lookout tower.  Resist the urge to head straight up as the terrain is more suited to goats than two-legged hikers.  The trail crosses several avalanche slopes and eventually intersects the ridge south of the lookout.  Another 500m of climbing along a gentle ridge and you have arrived.

Backcountry skiers and snowshoers use their knowledge of the geography or GPS to know where they are. \r\n\r\nThis trail provides for hut to hut hikes from several access points. Huts are owned, managed and maintained by the Kludahk Outdoors Club (KOC) a registered not for profit society. For information on membership and booking the huts ($15/person night) visit their website at www.kludahk.com. The KOC has also built 5 tent platforms near most huts for those wishing to do multiday hikes.",

In order to protect the backcountry recreation experience, no motorized vehicles are allowed on the trail, or within 400 meters of the lakeshore.  The lake has been stocked with rainbow trout, and the water in the lake is exceptionally clear. Rustic facilities are available at two locations on the lakeshore for those wanting to tent or just to enjoy for the day.   A hiking trail can also be followed around the entire lake, and the trail along the north side of the lake is believed to follow the same route used by Lieutenant Henry Spencer Palmer, a Royal Engineer whose orders in 1862 were to find a suitable location for a road from the coast to the interior, from North Bentinck Arm to Fort Alexander (Alexandria). The trail around the lake is about 4 km in length and takes about 2 hours to complete.",

When venturing along this historic 13 km trail, you will be surrounded by a dense, mossy forest that leads you over a small creek and past a minor talus slope. Once the trail has levelled, you will find yourself at an outlook point with incredible views of the Fraser Canyon. There are several ponds and small lakes situated closely along the length of the trail.\r\n\r\nThere is an excellent campsite available for those wanting to stay the night at the 6.5 km mark.\r\n\r\nVisit http://www.hopemountain.org/for more trail info.",

At the confluence of the Chilko and Taseko Rivers, visitors will be treated to the spectacular contrast of the milky, glacial till-laden Taseko River mixing with the clear blue waters of the Chilko River. \r\n \r\n The Chilko-Taseko Junction recreation site is commonly used as a point for whitewater rafters and kayakers to put in or take out as they raft the mighty Chilko River.",
				"DRIVING_DIRECTIONS" : "From Alexis Creek, travel 19 km west on Hwy 20 and turn left onto the Chilko-Newton Road.  Travel 1.3 km and turn left.  Cross the bridge over the Chilcotin River, and continue onto the 7000 Road.  Travel 4.3 km and turn right off the 700 Road (if you cross the bridge over the Chilko River, you have gone too far). Four-wheel drive is recommended from this point.  Continue another 11.5 km and turn left.  The recreation site is reached in another 600 meters.",

This section requires less effort and makes for a rewarding short hike (1-hour return). The next km or so of trail climbs steadily gaining elevation via numerous switchbacks. The remaining 2 kms to the top climbs more moderately, the last 200 meters becoming a flat ridge top which on a clear day offers the great views making it well worth the effort! If you are hiking the trail in late July or August you will likely find some great huckleberry picking near the top!  \r\n\r\nCurrently the original trail, which continues on for another 3.5 kms, near to the top of Mount Hayes is neither maintained, nor easy to find in places thus not recommended for hiking.\r\nOld boardwalk (boards) through some of the meadows mark the trail however it is extremely slippery and unsafe to walk on especially when wet!\r\n\r\nElevation gain is approximately 450 meters.

Follow the old mining track that runs parallel to a creek for about 2.2 km to an alpine lake and park here.  From here, the trail follows the switchbacks of the mining track north of the lake, accessing the northeast ridge of Perkins Peak, and a relatively short ridge ramble takes you to the official summit of Perkins Peak.  There is a register at the summit to sign your name and find out about others that have successfully made the trek.  The trail head is located at  51?49'31.89\"N 125? 1'54.95\"W",

				"SITE_DESCRIPTION" : "The first 6.2 km of this trail follows a bulldozed road constructed for mineral exploration.  The road gradient is relatively steep at an average of 13 per cent. Depending on your vehicle type and experience level with navigating steep and narrow roads, you can either choose to park at the first parking area close to Bluff Lake Road, or if you have an ATV or small 4-wheel drive vehicle you can drive up the steep and narrow access road for 6.2 km and park here.  Because the road can be quite difficult to navigate, we strongly recommend that most users park at the first parking area and walk or ATV to the second parking area and begin hiking from here.  The trail to Butler Lake from this parking area is another 5.4 km and takes about 3 hours to reach the lake.  There are no facilities at the lake, but it has been used for a base camp for overnight hikers looking to explore the surrounding area.  From this parking area, you can also choose to do a shorter hike up to Butler Peak, which is only about 2.1 km or about 1.5 to 2 hours.  Due to the moderately difficult and remote terrain, and the need for some route-finding once in the subalpine or where the trail becomes less obvious, this trail is recommended only for those with backcountry hiking experience. The trail also provides an access route for multi-day traverses along the Niut Range, with alpine routes possible to Valleau Creek basin, Jamison Creek basin, or Crazy Creek basin.",

In the spring and early summer the daisies and fireweed put on quite a show. As you enter the forest, the character of the trail changes. Some unusual flowers you may be lucky enough to spot under the canopy are Broom-rape, Coral root, Candystick or Twayblade.

A sharp eye will find old shoes, tools, bottles and other remnants from miners who toiled their way up and down this trail in search of fortunes.\r\n\r\nThe lower portions of the trail climb through semi-open forests of cedar, hemlock, white pine, lodgepole pine, fir and birch which offer the promise of good mushrooming in the fall. As the trail climbs, it emerges from the forest, crossing steep avalanche paths richly coloured with wild flowers. Old mine tailings and ruins of mine buildings are passed as the trail winds its way steeply upwards. As you cross the upper slopes, panoramic views of the Valhallas and the peaks of Kokanee Glacier Park dominate the landscape.\r\n\r\n",

Recreationists should be aware of\r\nthe potential for avalanches at almost anytime of year.  At the pass there is a small cabin and a rustic campsite for the use of hikers and horseback riders.  The pass is a good place for viewing goats and big horn sheep.  Bear sightings are not unusual, so be prepared.  From the pass, skilled route finders can follow an indistinct and intermittent trail north up Brule Creek.  Follow the obvious route, and you will soon come upon a well-defined trail, which continues east down Brule Creek to the Elk River valley. This section of the trail is about 9.5 km long.",

				"SITE_DESCRIPTION" : "The Trapping Creek Horse Trails are mainly old grassy two-track logging trails connected by enhanced cow paths and game trails, so the terrain varies. The horse trail network boasts several loops connecting the camps, with varying distances between 3-12 miles and several good creek crossings. Altitude changes on the trails on the North/West side of the creek are gradual. The greatest elevation change is approximately 1500' over about 2.5 miles. The trails on the South/East side of the creek are pretty flat. For some, the many crossings of Trapping Creek can be challenging during the height of spring runoff, which is usually short but powerful and depends on the snowpack melt.\r\nThere are 3 camp areas along the Trapping Creek FSR. Each will allow for 3 truck/trailer rigs to comfortably fit. Access to the campsites are on a first come-first serve basis. Other recreational campers also utilize these sites and in the late fall the area is very popular with hunters. \r\n\r\nThe camping areas are primitive, but all have rock fire-pits. You will need to bring your own water as the creeks, while close by, aren't close enough for packing water. The 3 camps along the FSR also all have lovely shady areas for your horses. Lots of room for setting up pens and hi-lining at all camps. Don't be surprised to see bovine visitors in any of the camps! They do come by to say hello from time to time.\r\n\r\nThe Trapping Creek is only a 5-10 minute walk from each of these 3 camps. There is firewood available, some on the ground and some dead standing. No shortage, but you will have to work for it. Bring your chainsaw. These camps can be a bit dusty during dry weather since they are right beside the Trapping Creek FSR, which is well-used by other Back Country enthusiasts and is active logging going on in the area on weekdays.\r\n",

Don't take it!\r\n\r\n\r\nStay on hwy 33 From this turn off you have about 28 or 29 km to go til you turn LEFT onto Trapping Creek Forest Service Rd. When you are getting close, you will see an old gravel pit area about 1 or 1.5 km before you turn off, it will be on your LEFT.\r\n\r\n\r\n1/8 mile or so before you turn LEFT onto Trapping Creek FSR there is a forestry fire sign on your left, the kind that has a little roof thingy on it.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe LEFT turn onto Trapping is a bit hidden, so go slow.\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce you turn, you immediately cross a cattle guard, then go 1/2K and cross the bridge.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are km signs on the Trapping Creek FSR.

There are trails on Swansea Mountain for hikers and cyclists.  \r\n\r\nHIKING TRAILS\r\n\r\nSUMMIT TRAIL \r\nHiking distance: 700m \r\nElevation gain: 105 metres\r\n\r\nThis short switchbacked trail leads from road's end (5km from the Windermere Loop Road) to the summit of Mount Swansea.   \r\n\r\n\r\nSWANSEA SLOPES TRAIL \r\nHiking distance: 10.3 km \r\nElevation gain: 745+ m \r\n\r\nA loop trail can be travelled by energetic hikers from the mountain base to summit and back down via a second south summit.  \r\n\r\nCYCLING TRAILS\r\n\r\nMt. Swansea offers more difficult (blue)level  and most difficult (black) level terrain.  Plenty of challenges await on the trails, including the steep descents of the Booty Call trail, the rocky, sandy slopes of Gravy Train, and plenty of wide open fun on Hula Girl. Trails can be shuttled or pedaled, as there is an uptrack.  \r\n\r\nUPTRACK\r\n\r\nAn uptrack for cycling and up or downhill hiking affords lesser grades from base to summit parking area.  \r\n \r\nParking options: \r\n1 -  mountain base, 2 - at the 2km mark for early season trail access and 3 - 5km parking area near the summit. \r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY\r\nIn the early 1900's copper was mined on a claim near the present day parking area.  In 1924, Mt. Swansea was established as a BC Forest Service fire lookout(1952 to 1992).\r\n\r\nThe mountain is internationally known as a premier hang gliding and paragliding launch. The first pilot to launch from the mountain was H. Portman in the early 1970's. For safety reasons, please keep clear of the launch ramps. \r\n",

Whitebark pine is also present at higher elevations. The mapped portion of the trail is about 7.6 km in length, but as with many of the trails in this region, it is possible to explore additional terrain once you reach the alpine, allowing for multi-day adventures for those with significant backcountry experience.  The trail offers spectacular views along its entire length, gradually exposing more of the Mosley Creek drainage as one ascends. A small primitive campsite with no facilities is located about 4.3 km up the trail at a point where the trail crosses Burnt Creek. Higher up the trail, lush alpine slopes open up as the creek forks into smaller tributaries. The trail takes about 3 to 5 hours to reach the top. Due to the moderately difficult and remote terrain, and the need for some route-finding once in the subalpine where the route becomes less obvious, this trail is recommended only for those with significant backcountry hiking experience.",

The trail provides access to many kilometres of open easy ridge hiking with great views.\r\nThe first section of this trail is a gentle grade that leads through a stand of large cedar and hemlock on the south side of Hanna Creek drainage and then enters an old cutblock. As the trail nears the end of the cutblock at 1.2 km the grade steepens and at times may be overgrown with alder. Hikers would be well advised to bring raingear for this section if it is wet.\r\nAt 3.2 km the trail reaches a low saddle on the ridge that is called \"Unnecessary Ridge\" by locals. From here there are several unmanaged trails that join the main trail. Old Glory trail lies to the right, and is marked with a small sign.\r\nTurning up the ridge, the grade becomes gentler and the sub-alpine forest opens up to allow glimpse views to both sides of the ridge. The trail continues at a moderate to gentle grade, winding its way up the ridge and starting into an old burn at 4.5 km. At 6.5 km the trail reaches a junction with Plewman Trail. From here Old Glory Peak is 2.0 km. From here the trail user has the option of following Plewman Trail down the other side of the Hanna Creek drainage to the trailhead (4.5 km), or continuing on to Old Glory.\r\nThe Forest Service fire lookout building perches at the very peak at an elevation 2376 m / 7795 ft. From this lofty perch 360 degree views of the surrounding areas reveal Goat Mountain and Big Sheep Creek drainage to the west, Mt.

Set your odometer to 0 here. \r\n\r\nFor the first 1.5 km, you need to watch for golfers crossing the road in three spots. The entrances are hidden by bushes, so be careful. Once you start climbing the hill, watch for heavy machinery and trucks at the gravel operation.\r\n\r\n3.5 km stay left at the Y. Traffic uses both roads, so pay attention and don?t miss this turn.

				"SITE_DESCRIPTION" : "This long, high-elevation, ridgetop trail is one of the few trails in this region located in an alpine setting. This is a new trail that is still under development. Sections of the trail have been constructed to a 'rustic' level, and the remainder has been marked with flagging tape and small orange triangles. Unless you plan to use it in the winter, you will need to wait until the trail is snow free, which is usually mid- June through mid-October. Be prepared for a rugged backcountry experience , and check with Boundary Forest District for the current state of development of the trial. You will also need to carry water with you as there is none available along the route.\r\n\r\nThe trail starts on an old road at the height of land on the Santa Rosa Summit. From here it winds its way north up a ridge line towards Mt. Saint Thomas. Starting in a sub-alpine forest, the trail climbs up and down the rolling ridge line, dipping in and out of the trees. On the high points along the ridge the trees give way to open alpine meadows and rock bluffs. From these areas trail users are treated to spectacular panoramic views in all directions. To the west and south lie Christina Lake and the Kettle River Valley, to the north and east the jagged peak of Old Glory and the Big Sheep Creek drainage.\r\n\r\nAs the trail nears Mt. Saint Thomas it splits into three: The right fork drops down to the Bonanza Creek parking area; the left fork is the Vertical Smile trail; and the middle fork is the trail the at leads to the peak of Mt. Saint Thomas.\r\n",
				"DRIVING_DIRECTIONS" : "To reach the southern end of this trail, start at the bridge in the town of Christina Lake. Head northeast on Highway 3 for 0.2 km to Santa Rosa Road. Turn right onto this good gravel road and follow it for 23.5 km to a cattleguard and road junction. The trailhead is marked with a brown and white 4 x 4 sign, and is located on the left just after the cattleguard. Park on the shoulder of the road well out of the way of\r\ntraffic. This road is suitable for 2wd vehicles and receives heavy use, so be prepared to meet other vehicles on corners.\r\n\r\nThe northern end of this trail is a bit harder to find, and a 4WD high clearance vehicle is recommended. Start at the bridge in the town of Christina Lake, and Drive 31 km east on Highway 3 to the Bonanza gravel pit on the right side of the highway. Drive through the gravel pit, and take the first right. Follow this road for 2.0 km to the junction and turn left. Continue for another 1.0 km, and take another left. At the next junction at the top of a hill, again stay left. At the next junction stay right, and continue on the main road. From here the road gets rougher and has frequent large waterbars. Continue on to the last junction, and take a right. Follow this road a short distance to the parking area on an old log landing. Look for a brown and white 4 x 4 sign post marking the trailhead. The trail follows old skid trails to the basin below Mt. Saint Thomas before it starts winding its way slowly toward the ridge to the south of the peak.\r\n",

This is an area you can enjoy whether you are out for a jog or a ramble. An easy walk along the Big Cedar Trail meanders through a mixed forest of cedar, hemlock, spruce, fir and birch. Most of this trail is wide enough for two people to walk side by side and enjoy each others company in the peace and quiet of this very special place. Look for the remains of the giant cedar - truly awe inspiring. On a hot summer day, this almost level, shade dappled trail offers respite from the heat.\r\n\r\nA little more ambitious hike up to the view point, on the Columbia View Trail, rewards one with a spectacular display of spring flowers early in the season. The fragile moss and lichen communities can be fully appreciated, as you pass right by them. This sun baked knoll offers an expansive view of Castlegar, the Columbia River and the Kootenay River. Sit down, catch your breath and take in the view.

				"SITE_DESCRIPTION" : "Description - Lassie Lake to Clark-Maloney Lakes\r\nThe first few hundred metres of the Clark Lake trail follow an overgrown skid road through an old cutblock to a wire gate. Please leave the gate as you found it. Shortly after the gate the trail narrows and enters a forest of small lodgepole pine. The trail winds across the gently rolling forested landscape and crosses several muddy areas before reaching a junction at 1.75 km just before Clark Lake. Stay left at this junction and follow the trail for a short distance to the forested campsite on the east side of the lake.\r\nClark Lake is a medium-sized lake with a shallow, weedy, muddy shoreline. There is good fishing in the lake. Fishers should consider bringing an inflatable boat or hip waders to reach deeper water.\r\nThe trail continues along the south shore of Clark Lake past the developed campsite, and slowly swings eastward towards Maloney Lake, another 2 km distance.\r\n\r\nDescription - Cup Lake to Maloney Lake\r\nThe trail into Maloney Lake starts at the end of a small road in the middle of a cutblock. This trail is not signed and has not been maintained for some time. Look for orange markers on trees that mark the trail as it skirts the bottom of the cutblock and proceeds south. As the little-used trail nears the campsite on the south side of the lake it joins a road leading from a cutblock into the site. The campsite itself is located in a small grassy opening in the trees. Maloney Lake is small, muddy, and shallow. The shores are so marshy it is difficult to approach open water easily. However, the lake offers good trout fishing if you persevere.\r\n\r\n",
				"DRIVING_DIRECTIONS" : "The trailheads into these two campsites can be reached from three directions: From the north via Trapping Creek Forest Service Road (FSR); from the east via the Main Kettle River - State FSR; and from the west via Beaverdell - State FSR. Directions are provided below for the most commonly used access route from the west. For information on other access routes consult local road maps.\r\n\r\nFrom the junction of highways 3 and 33 in Rock Creek, turn north onto Highway 33. Follow this highway for 50.8 km to the junction with the Beaver Creek Road located just north of the town of Beaverdell. Turn right onto this road and follow it for 24.6 km to the junction with the State FSR. Turn left onto State FSR, and continue for 3.5 km to the junction with Lassie FSR. Stay left at this junction and proceed for another 1.9 km to a junction with a small road on the left across from Cup Lake. This is the access road into Maloney Lake, and it is narrow and has frequent waterbars. If you don't have a high-clearance vehicle, you probably shouldn't attempt to drive this road. Turn left up this road and proceed for another 2.8 km to the trailhead.\r\n\r\nTo find the Clark Lake trailhead, proceed north on Lassie FSR another 3.3 km past the turnoff to Maloney Lake (a total of 5.2 km up Lassie FSR). Look for a small parking area and a brown 4 x 4 post marking the trailhead on the left just past the Lassie Lake campsite turnoff.\r\n",

No matter how you do it, be sure to give yourself time to poke around the old mine sites, admire the rock work and pause to take in the views. From Sandon to Payne Bluff is an easy stroll. To make it easier, drive the first 2.3 km and then it is only 3.8 km to Payne Bluff. If you have a way back from Three Forks, you can take the old pack trail, down to the highway from Payne Siding. If you want a bit of a workout, start at Three Forks. The first section of trail takes you to the old CPR grade. Follow this for 300 metres, then look for a sign that directs you to the left and up, onto the old pack trail. After a steep 1.4 km you are at Payne Siding. Turn left to Payne Bluff, which is 300 metres along the railway grade. Biking? The first 2.5 km from Sandon is a pleasant family bike ride.

Rather than going over the bridge, continue straight ahead on Reco Street for 500 metres to the \"K & S Historic Railway Trail\" interpretive sign and trail head.

				"SITE_DESCRIPTION" : "Effectively March 24 2020, RSTBC is temporarily closing recreation facilities and suspending services at many recreation sites and trails across BC. We are also recommending that people avoid travelling outside of their communities for recreation purposes at this time. Our response to COVID-19 continues to change based on direction from the British Columbia Provincial Health Officer (PHO). We will continue to communicate regularly. For now, visitors can expect the following: \r\n\r\n Recreation trails are available for local use at this time. Visitors are reminded of the directives from the PHO to avoid gathering in groups and to keep at least two metres apart from each other when using trails. Trail users are responsible for their own safety and should exercise additional caution as trails will not be groomed or maintained during this time. As well, visitors are asked to avoid activities with a high risk of injury to minimize potential impacts on the medical system. \r\n\r\n Recreation facilities where people gather and are in contact with frequently touched surfaces will be closed. Closures will apply to fee collection booths and kiosks, overnight shelters, backcountry cabins, day use shelters, and other related infrastructure. \r\n\r\n This recreation trail is primarily used by snowmobiles to access a popular snowmobile riding area at Mica Mountain.  To ensure continued access to this alpine snowmobile area, users are responsible for making themselves aware of and staying out of areas that are closed for snowmobile use in order to protect sensitive mountain caribou. Users are also strongly encouraged to be prepared and trained for riding in avalanche conditions, and to check with the Canadian Avalanche Centre for the latest avalanche information applicable for the area. A trail fee of $20/day is in effect for users of the trail during the winter months.",

Travel to 60-18km and turn right onto the Spanish Creek Forest Service Road (7000 Road). Please note that trail grooming activities and the location of the designated parking area are variable each year, depending on the amount of industrial use and snow ploughing levels on this Forest Service Road.  Continue on the 7000 Road for about 36 km to the trailhead, located just a few kilometers north of Spanish Lake.  Here, users will find toilets, a covered shelter with a wood stove, and a memorial sign.  Follow the trail northwest to access the designated snowmobile riding area.",

Both sets of trails are designed to International Mountain Bike standards and are well marked with signage and maps throughout. \r\n\r\nThe \"River Walk Trail\" winds through field and forest alongside the north bank of the Kettle River from a Kiosk located south of Midway's Airport just past the hanger buildings. The \"River Walk Trail\" is a very easy trail for all 4 seasons. It is flat and used for hiking, dog walking, biking, and snowshoeing and cross country skiing for users of all levels. There are benches along the trail and a picnic bench at the west end of the trail just before you reach the Kiosk and the intersection with the Trans Canada Trail. At the end of this trail you will emerge onto the Trans Canada Trail where you can either return along the river or follow the Trans Canada Trail east back into the Village of Midway. \r\n\r\nThe other trail network is located on the mountains south of Midway between town and the Canada/ US border. It is a little more challenging as it is a mountain trail but is well designed and maintained. There are over 12 kms of multi-looped trails on the mountain and you can spend just an hour or all day to explore them. A favorite hike for an hour or so is to the flag at the end of the Village View trail and back. There are maps at the trail entrances on the Kiosks and at all major intersections. Paper maps can also be found in registration boxes and at the Museum on the Highway and from the Campground Host at Riverfront Park or downloaded from the trails website at http://midwaytrails.tripod.com. You can also click on the link to our Facebook Fan Page from this site and get more information about the trails. For hikers that want to take a break there are benches all around the trail system. \r\n",
				"DRIVING_DIRECTIONS" : "To access the \"River walk Trails\" turn south off of Highway 3 between the Mile O Motel and \"The Spot\" Gas Station onto Florence. Turn right off of Florence onto 7th Ave. (you will see the sign pointing to the trail on this corner) Follow 7th to its end and park near the Kiosk. To access the Mountain Trails you turn south off of Highway 3 between the Mile O Motel and \"The Spot\" Gas Station. Follow Florence south through the village and across the bridge to the end of Florence St. where it turns right onto Fritz Rd. Follow this road west to either of two kiosks at trailheads approx. 600 meters and 1300 meters from Florence St.. Here you will find maps and other trail information. Park and enjoy your time on the many loops of trails available.  Be sure to sign in at registration boxes located around the trail system. It is always interesting for us to see where our visitors are from and to hear what their impressions and suggestions are. It also helps us to apply for more funding to maintain and improve our trails. Thanks for your visit.",

This trail, used by the First Nations people, Hudson Bay Fur Traders and gold seekers, is rated moderate and is not recommended for the �weak knees.�  The whole route is approximately 74 km long when travelling from Peers Creek/HBC Trail recreation site trailhead (Hope side access) and exiting at the Tulameen Plateau, west of Princeton.   The beginning of trail travels over Peers Creek then continues up and over an old logging road taking you through old-growth timber where you will discover many new trail and campsite improvements.  Lots of designated campsites are available along this trail, making it popular for those multi-night excursions. There are some major elevation gains, therefore users are encouraged to bring hiking poles.  Travelling on horseback, you will find structures to facilitate horses such as designated Horse Corral. Take in the many historical campsites, other Points of Interests and information kiosks that are marked along the way.  \r\n\r\nViews along the unspoiled beauty of the Cascade Mountains, from Mount Davis to the Tulameen plateau are offered along this trek.\r\n\r\nThere are no services so pack-out what you pack-in, respect the trail�s status and obey all signage.\r\n\r\nFor more information visit www.hopemountain.org\r\n",
				"DRIVING_DIRECTIONS" : "Heading north from Hope, take the Kawkawa Lake Exit #183 and take the left hand turn onto a one-lane bridge which marks the beginning of the Peers Creek Forest Service Road.  Once past the bridge, turn right following the logging road for approximately 1.0 km where you will find parking at the Peers Creek/HBC Trail Recreation Site and the H.B.C. Brigade Trail trailhead.\r\n\r\nHowever depending on your preference of access and distance wishing to travel along this trail, four trailhead points exist. When accessing from the Coquihalla side; a trailhead exists at the Peers Creek/HBC Heritage Recreation Site, another at the Sowaqua Creek Trailhead accessed via the Sowaqua Creek Forest Service Road and the third via the Tulameen Forest Service Road.  The forth is accessed from the Whatcom Trail Junction when coming from Princeton where a 4WL drive is required. \r\n\r\nBefore heading out visit the Chilliwack District website for Forest Service Road access and limitations at www.for.gov.bc.ca/dck/",

Climbing up a skid trail through an old cut block rampant with flowers, the trail soon narrows as it enters a sub-alpine forest. It continues to climb, following a small stream, emerging from the forest into a basin below the pass where frequent bear diggings warn you to be alert. You will see your destination, a low pass, up and to the left. Follow the stream to the base of the talus slope. The trail is to the left. Cairns mark the route. Early in the season, the trail may be snow covered requiring some route finding skills. As you climb steadily upward, the views unfold, and the sight of the pass ahead urges you on.\r\n\r\nThe pass, which an hour and a half ago was your objective, now is a minor victory as your eyes take in the panoramic view. This is a good place to stop and have a bit of lunch while you decide which ridge to walk ... which flowered slopes to explore.\r\n\r\nOne of the best flower shows is usually to your left, on the ridge between Marten and Dennis Creek. From this ridge, one has spectacular views of Mt. Dolly Varden, Marten Mountain, Inverness Mountain, Mt. Dryden, Whitewater Mountain, London Ridge, Kokanee Glacier and the New Denver Glacier.

				"SITE_DESCRIPTION" : "This trail is an historic trail constructed starting in 1865 by Edgar Dewdney. Dewdney was a young surveyor who was commissioned by Governor James Douglas to develop a trail from Hope, B.C. east 590 km to gold fields in the East Kootenays near Fort Steel. The Dewdney Trail was the main route through this area until the Cascade Highway (now known as the Santa Rosa Road) replaced it in the 1920's.\r\n\r\nBoundary Forest District manages a 15 km section of this trail that runs from the town of Christina Lake to the Santa Rosa Summit. From here the trail extends another 24 km to near Rossland. \r\n\r\nThe section of trail in the Boundary District is crossed by the Santa Rosa Road (old Cascade Highway) in two locations and follows the road for a short distance at 9.7 km (trail distance). The trail is also dissected by and follows power transmission line corridors in several places. The trail can be a little tricky to find here, but is well marked for the most part. \r\n",
				"DRIVING_DIRECTIONS" : "Start at the bridge on Highway 3 in the town of Christina Lake and head northeast for 0.2 km to the Santa Rosa Road. Turn right onto this good gravel road and follow it for 1.4 km to a large pullout on the left side of the road just before a steep switchback. Park here, and proceed up and across the road to the steep switchback. Climb over the cement barrier and down the bank to the abandoned Kettle Valley Railway grade. Proceed south along the railway grade a few metres until you cross a small creek. Look on your left for the unmarked trailhead just after the creek (south bank).\r\n\r\nThe trail also crosses the Santa Rosa Road at 3.7 km, 9.5 km, and 14.5 km (road distance). Any of these crossings could be used as access points. All crossings are marked with white and green Dewdney Trail signs. Another possible access point is located on a side road that crosses the trail. To find this access drive approximately 7.0 km up the Santa Rosa Road, and look for a side road on the left. Turn up this road and follow it for approximately 2.0 km, following the most used route. Look here for a brown and white sign marking the trail crossing.\r\n",

The trail also serves as a mountaineering access to the Spillimacheen Glacier. \r\n\r\nThe trail travels through mature forest as it crosses over several small creeks and wet areas before entering an avalanche path.  Hike up this slide area and continue ascending through sub-alpine meadows until you reach Silent Lake. \r\n\r\nThe trail is not maintained beyond this point but hiking through the open terrain is rewarded by views of the peaks of Glacier National Park to the northwest and Spillimacheen Glacier to the southeast.\r\n\r\nSilent Pass is a very popular snowmobiling destination in snow season.  A fee for the groomed trail along lower elevation roads is charged.  Trail report and info: www.snowmobilegolden.com",

The crystal clear pool at the foot of the lower fall invites dabbling. The entire scene is framed by a lush cedar forest. Bring a picnic lunch to enjoy at the table, while you cool off by the falls. In the autumn, look for mushrooms on the lower portions of the trail. At other times of the year, shade loving plants such as Indian Pipe can be found.

Climbing up a skid trail through an old cut block rampant with flowers, the trail soon narrows as it enters a sub-alpine forest. It continues to climb, following a small stream, emerging from the forest into a basin below the pass where frequent bear diggings warn you to be alert. You will see your destination, a low pass, up and to the left. Follow the stream to the base of the talus slope. The trail is to the left. Cairns mark the route.

As you climb steadily upward, the views unfold, and the sight of the pass ahead urges you on.\r\n\r\nThe pass, which an hour and a half ago was your objective, now is a minor victory as your eyes take in the panoramic view. This is a good place to stop and have a bit of lunch while you decide which ridge to walk ... which flowered slopes to explore.\r\n\r\nOne of the best flower shows is usually to your left, on the ridge between Marten and Dennis Creek.
